pyplot
======

Simple Plot for training in mathematics. Pyplot generates a coordinate system
based on the given values. 

At the moment only Integer are allowed. Basically multiple of 100. Like 500x800. Width and Height under 100px are not
realistic and the algorithm can't calculate with <100px values. Steps have a static value of 50px and I'm working on a solution.
